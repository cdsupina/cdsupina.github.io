                                I created Micronote in the summer of 2018 with Shristi as a part of Purdue's Engineering
                                accelerator program. At the end of the summer program we were convinced that Micronote
                                was a good idea that was worth continuing. Since then, we have added Sabharsh and Holden to the team
                                and have been working with students, high schools, and universities to develop engineering kits
                                that teach electronics and programming.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I went to high school in Minnesota and that is where I started really getting into programming and electronics.
                                I was in science olympiad when I was introduced to Arduino and Raspberry Pi. My first attempt to use Arduino was a robot
                                arm built from scratch for a science olympiad event. It was barely functional, but overall did not work very well.
                                Looking back, I am disappointed in the lack of opportunities provided to learn programming and electronics to me while
                                in high school in Minnesota. I was ready to learn, but I couldn't find a good starting point
                                that was at my level.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                As a senior my family moved to the Dalarna region of Sweden for a year where I attended a music school.
                                I had a tremendous amount of free time. Still wanting to learn electronics and programming skills, I decided
                                to take matters into my own hands. While in Sweden I learned how to create 3D models using
                                <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview">3DS Max</a> and I learned how to make games using
                                the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity game engine</a>. I didn't create any masterpieces in this time, but
                                I did make a few games that I still show off to friends. I also learned many essential programming
                                and CAD skills that I still use to this day.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                As a freshman in university I dedicated time every weekend to learning how to do something new with Arduino.
                                Eventually I applied those skills to create a rather humorous project for Uncommon Hacks called
                                <a href="https://devpost.com/software/telememe-meme-improvement-kit">"Telememe - Meme Improvement Bundle"</a>.
                                I went to many more hackathons in the next two years where I learned more skills relating to electronics,
                                web development, computer vision, game design, and blockchain.
                                </p>

                                While in school I have had two internships. In the first, I helped a mentor of mine design small conveyor belts
                                to sort small objects using machine vision and a variety of other sensors. I also programmed a hopper to dispense coins
                                onto a conveyor belt at regular intervals. My second internship was with 3M where I used Xamarin to create cross platform
                                mobile apps that had the ability to scan tags. Also at 3M, I worked with another group to kickstart 3M's presence
                                in blockchain mentioned in the <a href="https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/10/how-blockchain-will-accelerate-business-performance-and-power-the-smart-economy">Harvard Business Review</a>.
                                Together our team submitted several patents for blockchain inventions, one of which is published and can be viewed
                                <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019030653A1/en?q=BLOCKCHAIN&oq=ARTICLE+ATTESTATION+SYSTEM+USING+BLOCKCHAIN">here</a>.
                                </p>

                                In the summer of 2019 I started two open source projects. Both of these projects use the Rust programming language,
                                a relatively new language which and specializes in memory safety. The first project is a space shooter game approiately named space_shooter_rs on
                                <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/space_shooter_rs">Github</a>. You can read more about the game on its <a href="/2019/09/Space-Shooter-Game/">project page</a>.
                                After a few months of continued development, I was approached
                                by a representative of the Amethyst engine about making it an official showcase game for the engine. I glady
                                <a href="https://amethyst.rs/posts/third-showcase-game-space-shooter">accepted</a>. This means that this game will be in the center
                                of the Amethyst community for people to learn from, contribute to, and show off the Amethyst engine with.

                                Games have been a huge part of my journey into programming. Often the first thing I do after learning a language
                                is to create a game using as many aspects of the language as possible. Games were my starting point, but for others it could
                                be something else. After starting Micronote, I have been finding myself everyday to be looking for ways to help people of all ages find their starting point into the amazing world of programming and
                                electronics.
